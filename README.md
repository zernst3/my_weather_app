This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My Weather React App

This is a basic React application I created to display the weather of a city in any given country.  This uses the weather api and displays relevant information once the city is selected.  One select feature is that it will detect if the country is the US or not, and adjust the temperature and wind speed units accordingly.

I would like to thank Youtube user "Hamza Mirza" for providing a basic React tutorial in which this app could be created.
